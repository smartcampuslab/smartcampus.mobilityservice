web.faq.left_menu=FAQ
web.faq.title1=Frequently Asked Questions 
web.faq.text1=<ol>\
              <li><b>How are Green Leaves points calculated?</b><br> \
              Green Leaves points calculation depends on the length (Km) of the itinerary tracked through the App, and on the sustainability of the mean of transportation used by the Player. Additionally, it is possible to gain bonus points (see answer to question n. 2).</li> \
              <li><b>How can I win bonus points?</b><br> \
              You can win bonus Green Leaves points by:<ol> \
                 <li>Choosing zero emissions journeys, i.e. exclusively by bike or on foot (additional points are assigned together with the points obtained for the corresponding itinerary);</li> \
                 <li>Inviting your friends to register to the game: your friend can provide your nickname during the registration procedure. The bonus will be awarded if the new player is active in the game;</li> \
                 <li>Succeeding in your weekly challenges.</li></ol></li>\
              <li><b>My trip has been in "validation" mode for several hours: what is happening?</b><br> \
              Sometimes the data registered and sent by the smartphone are not sufficient to automatically verify the validity of the itinerary and award the related Green Leaves points. The journey will be validated by an operator and the points will be awarded once the itinerary is verified and confirmed.</li> \
              <li><b>One of my journey is "not valid": why?</b><br> \
              You can report the case to the Play & Go team by using the "Report an issue" function located in the Menu on the left side of the App or by sending an e-mail to playandgo@smartcommunitylab.it. Make sure you include the information about the type of the journey (mean of transportation), and the date and time of the journey. The Play & Go team will verify the itinerary and award the points if an error occurred.</li> \
              <li><b>Why have some of the points I gained been revoked?</b><br> \
              Green Leaves points and badges can be revoked at the incontestable discretion of the Organizers if violations to the rules of the game are spotted.</li> \
              <li><b>Why did I get only some of the points related to the journeys I made during one day?</b><br> \
              There are daily limits to the Km and journeys that can be performed and tracked by a single Player (10 Km on foot, 30 Km by bike/bike sharing, 8 trips with public transportation, 4 trips on cable car). If you think you did not exceed the limits, please report the case to the Play & Go team (by using the \u201CReport an issue\u201D function located in the Menu on the left side of the App or by sending an e-mail to playandgo@smartcommunitylab.it).</li> \
              <li><b>My "planned journey" is not valid: why?</b><br> \
              This might happen if the tracked itinerary or the means of transportation you used differ from the planned journey. You can access the "Game Diary" (from "Play&Go" in the Home page of the App), select the journey and compare the planned itinerary (green track) with tracked itinerary (blue track). If you don\u2019t find substantial differences between the two itineraries, please report the case to the Play & Go team (by using the "Report an issue" function located in the Menu on the left side of the App or by sending an e-mail to playandgo@smartcommunitylab.it).</li> \
              <li><b>Can I play if I travel outside the Municipalities of Trento and Rovereto?</b><br> \
              All journeys starting or ending in the territory of the two Municipalities are valid for the game.</li> \
              <li><b>Why has the rank changed on Saturday morning, after the end of the week (Friday)?</b><br> \
              Weekly ranking is to be considered official the Monday following the end of each week (from Saturday to Friday), when all "in validation" cases will be verified and possible mistakes amended. The winners of the prizes will be announced during the following week.</li> \
              <li><b>Can I participate to Trento e Rovereto Play&Go if I own a Windows smartphone?</b><br> \
              Unfortunately, this edition of the game is available only for Android and iOS smartphones.</li> \
