web.faq.title1=Frequently Asked Questions 
web.faq.text1=<ol>\
              <li><b>How are Green Leaves points calculated?</b><br> \
              Green Leaves points calculation depends on the length (Km) of the itinerary tracked through the App, and on the sustainability of the mean of transportation used by the Player. Additionally, it is possible to gain bonus points (see answer to question n. 2).</li> \
              <li><b>How can I win bonus points?</b><br> \
              You can win bonus Green Leaves points by:<ol> \
                 <li>Choosing zero emissions journeys, i.e. exclusively by bike or on foot (additional points are assigned together with the points obtained for the corresponding itinerary);</li> \
                 <li>Inviting your friends to register to the game: your friend can provide your nickname during the registration procedure. The bonus will be awarded if the new player is active in the game;</li> \
                 <li>Succeeding in your weekly challenges.</li></ol></li>\
              <li><b>One of my journey is "not valid": why?</b><br> \
              If the information registered may be out of the parameters that are defined for each mean of transportation. If you think the trip has been wrongly considered not valid, you can report it to Play&Go team by using the <i>"Report an issue"</i> function located in the Menu on the left side of the App or by sending an e-mail to playandgo@smartcommunitylab.it. Make sure you include the information about the type of the journey (mean of transportation), and the date and time of the journey. Play&Go team will verify the itinerary and award the points if an error occurred.</li> \
              <li><b>Why have some of the points I gained been revoked?</b><br> \
              Green Leaves points and badges can be revoked at the incontestable discretion of the Organisers if violations to the rules of the game are spotted. The Organisers will do spot check to identify incorrect behaviours.</li> \
              <li><b>Why did I get only some of the points related to the journeys I made during one day?</b><br> \
              There are daily limits for each mode of tracking (10 Km on foot, 30 Km by bike/bike sharing, 8 trips with public transportation, 4 trips on cable car). If you think you did not exceed the limits, please report the case to the Play & Go team (by using the <i>"Report an issue"</i> function located in the Menu on the left side of the App or by sending an e-mail to playandgo@smartcommunitylab.it).</li> \
              <li><b>Where is the "Planning" function in the app?</b><br> \
              The Planning function is located in the "Mobility" page. You can access it from the lateral menu or selecting the icon located on the right corner of the low part of the screen in the Home page.</li> \
              <li><b>My "planned journey" is not valid: why?</b><br> \
              This might happen if the tracked itinerary or the means of transportation you used differ from the planned journey. You can access the "Game Diary" (from "Play&Go" in the Home page of the App), select the journey and compare the planned itinerary (green track) with tracked itinerary (blue track). If you don't find substantial differences between the two itineraries, please report the case to the Play&Go team (by using the <i>"Report an issue"</i> function located in the Menu on the left side of the App or by sending an e-mail to playandgo@smartcommunitylab.it).</li> \
              <li><b>Can I participate if I travel outside Trento and Rovereto municipalities?</b><br> \
              All trips correctly tracked within the area of Provincia di Trento are valid..</li> \
              <li><b>Why has the rank changed on Saturday morning, after the end of the week (Friday)?</b><br> \
              Weekly ranking is to be considered official the Monday following the end of each week (from Saturday to Friday), when possible mistakes will be amended. The winners of the prizes will be announced during the following week.</li> \
			<li><b>What happens when I reach a new level?</b><br> \
			Depending on the phase of the Game and the reached level, scaling to a different level could cause: \
			<ul> \
			<li>Increasing number of challenges available for the player's choice;</li> \
			<li>Unlock new types of challenges (eg. challenge another player) available for the following weeks.</li> \
			</ul> \
			<li><b>I've invited a friend to participate in the Game but I have not received the related bonus points yet.</b><br> \
			In order to receive the bonus points related to the subscription of a new player, the new player must write the friend's nickname in the "Who has invited you to the game?" section. Additionally, the player must be an active player in the game before the bonus is awarded.</li> \
            <li><b>Can I participate to Trento e Rovereto Play&Go if I own a Windows smartphone?</b><br> \
            Unfortunately, this edition of the game is available only for Android and iOS smartphones.</li> \
            </ol>
web.faq.title2=Frequently Asked Questions Couple Challenges
web.faq.text2=<ol> \
					<li><b>What does competitive challenge mean?</b><br />In a competitive challenge, a player challenges another player to reach a mobility goal. There are two types of competitive challenges: time-based and performance-based. In order to win a time-based competitive challenge, the player must reach the goal before the opponent, while to win a performance-based competitive challenge, the player has to obtain a better result within the duration of the challenge. Points will be awarded only to the winner of the challenge, or to both players in case of a draw.</li> \
					<li><b>What does collaborative challenge mean?</b><br />In a collaborative challenge, two players play together to reach the same goal. The points and distances gained by the players during the period of the challenge will be summed. If the goal is reached, both players will gain the corresponding points.</li> \
					<li><b>Why can't I unlock the new types of challenges?</b><br />By reaching certain levels, you can unlock one or more types of couple challenges.<br />Level 4 [1500 GL; <b>Green Soldier</b>] - 1 type of couple challenge.<br />Level 5 [2200 GL; <b>Green Master</b>] - 2 types of couple challenges.<br />From Level 6 onwards [3500 GL; <b>Green Ambassador</b>] 3 types of couple challenges.</li> \
					<li><b>How can I plan the couple challenges?</b><br />To program a couple challenge, follow the steps below:<br /> \
					<ul> \
					<li>from the Home Page choose 'Plan the next challenge' (present from Wednesday to noon Friday);</li> \
					<li>in the section 'Future' of the challenges page, click 'Choose your opponent' corresponding to the</li> \
					<li>chosen type of a couple challenge;</li> \
					<li>configure the challenge:<br /> \
					<ul> \
					<li>choose the counter (how you prefer to face the challenge: on foot, by bike or on GL points);</li> \
					<li>choose the opponent (from the list or entering the player's nickname);</li> \
					<li>calculate the objective (given the counter and the opponent, the goal to be achieved and the respective bonus is automatically computed; the bonus vary according to the complexity of the challenge for the players);</li> \
					<li>send the challenge request. \
					</li> \
					</ul> \
					You can try different configurations of the challenge (counter, opponent) to find the most interesting one (goal and bonus) before sending the invitation. After sending the invitation, you can cancel it at any time (by 12.00 P.M. on Friday, deadline for the choices of all types of challenges) and you can proceed with sending another invitation. \
					</li> \
					<li><b>Why can&rsquo;t I challenge all players?</b><br />Each player can invite all players who are positioned between the two previous levels and the two levels after the level of the player proposing the challenge (eg, if the player is at level 5, he can challenge players of level 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7).<br />It is not possible to invite a player who has already scheduled the challenge for the following week or who has already received three invitations for the couple challenges.<br />Moreover, it is not possible to challenge players who are in the blacklist and / or who have blacklisted the player who wants to propose the challenge.</li> \
					<li><b>How do I add/remove a player from the blacklist?</b><br />To add a player to the blacklist you need to access his/her profile (from the leaderboard) and click the button at the top right of the player's profile page. In the same way you can remove the player from the blacklist at any time.<br />You can consult your blacklist by accessing your profile from the Home Page or the Ranking and clicking on the icon at the bottom right.</li> \
					<li><b>Can I cancel the invitation?</b><br />Once configured and sent the invitation for a couple challenge, the message indicating the challenge will be replaced by the invitation made with the possibility to cancel it (if it has not already been accepted / refused by the invited player). In case of refusal or cancellation of the invitation you have the possibility to proceed with another invitation (always by 12.00 on Friday).</li> \
					<li><b>How can I know if someone has invited me to a challenge?</b><br />When a player is challenged, he receives a notification (both in the App and in the game diary) and the invitations are displayed in the "Future" section of the challenges page.</li> \
					<li><b>Can I know the progress of my opponent in the challenge?</b><br />After the start of the challenge (from Saturday) you can see both your progress in the challenge and that of your opponent.</li> \
					<li><b>After having unlocked one type of couple challenge will it be available also in future?</b><br />The unlocked challenges will always be available for future choices.</li> \
					<li><b>Why did I get a challenge I did not choose?</b><br />Every week each player has at least one active challenge. Depending on the level, the player can choose between one or more challenges proposed either by the system or by other players. If, on Friday at 12.00 PM the player does not choose one of the challenges, the system will automatically assign a challenge.</li> \
					<li><b>I did not choose a challenge and the deadline to choose the challenge has not expired: why was I assigned a challenge anyway?</b><br />If a player accepts one of the challenges you proposed, that challenge becomes automatically your challenge for the following week. </li> \
					</ol>
